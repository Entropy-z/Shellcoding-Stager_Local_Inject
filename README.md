# Shellcoding - Stager & Local Inject

The development of a shellcode Stager employs the WinHttp library to fetch the payload and utilizes Fibers to execute it. The project is divided into two distinct parts: the Ldr and the Shellcode.

## Shellcode

## Ldr 
The Ldr is the code responsible for executing the shellcode.
